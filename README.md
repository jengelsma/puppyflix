Simple iOS YouTube client that demonstrates the XCTest unit / ui test capabilities. This is a simple but representative iOS app that I 
wrote to demonstrate test automation using Apple's XCTest.  The app integrates with YouTube APIs to display a table of cute puppy videos.
The API integration is tested using the OHHTTPStubs pod.  There are also some simple automated UI tests.
